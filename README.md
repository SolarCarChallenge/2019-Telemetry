# 2019-Telemetry

Abouth the files:
Raspberry GUI - A variation on the basic telemetry program that uses a 800X480 LCD screen as a user interface

Telemetery QML - The program to view real time data from the solar car.  Works on linux and PC.  Has not been tested on a MAC but should work once the libraries are imported.

Mail Home - A simple script that will cause your device to email you its IP address.  This can be run at startup to determine the IP so that it can easily be accessed by VNC or Telnet

SolarCarTelemetry - The most bare bowns version of the telemetry program for the solar car.  There is no user interface.  If loaded at astartup Telemetry.py will cause data to be uploaded continously.  This folder also contains scripts to setup databases and test components.

Manual No Display is the instruction manual for the basic system.  It is a good starting point for all projects.  More documentation will be forth coming.
